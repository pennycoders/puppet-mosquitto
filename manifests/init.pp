# Class: mosquitto
#
# Author: Alex P.
# This module manages mosquitto
#
# Parameters:
#
# [*manage_repo*]
# Whether the mosquitto repo should be added or not, defaults to true
# # [*manage_service*]
#  Whether to manage the mosquitto service or not
#
#
# [*service_name*]
#  Service name to manage
#
# [*conf_template*]
#  The path to a puppet template file to be rendered as the main mosquitto configuration file
#  defaults to mosquitto/mqtt.conf.erb
#
# [*manage_service*]
#  Whether to manage the mosquitto service or not
#
# [*conf_template*]
# The path to a template file, defaults to mosquitto/mqtt.conf.erb
#
# [*allow_anonymous*]
# Boolean value that determines whether clients that connect without providing a username are allowed to connect. If set to false
# then another means of connection should be created to control authenticated client access. Defaults to true.
#
# Reloaded on reload signal.
#
# [*auth_opt_qos*]
# The path to a template file, defaults to mosquitto/mqtt.conf.erb
#
# [*allow_duplicate_messages*]
# If a client is subscribed to multiple subscriptions that overlap, e.g. foo/# and foo/+/baz , then MQTT expects that when the
# broker receives a message on a topic that matches both subscriptions, such as foo/bar/baz, then the client should only receive the
# message once.
#
# Mosquitto keeps track of which clients a message has been sent to in order to meet this requirement. This option allows this
# behaviour to be disabled, which may be useful if you have a large number of clients subscribed to the same set of topics and want
# to minimise memory usage.
#
# It can be safely set to true if you know in advance that your clients will never have overlapping subscriptions, otherwise your
# clients must be able to correctly deal with duplicate messages even when then have QoS=2.
#
# Defaults to true.
#
# Reloaded on reload signal.
#
# [*conf_template*]
# The path to a template file, defaults to mosquitto/mqtt.conf.erb
#

# Requires: see Modulefile
